Project Lumiere is a Virtual Fashion Manager built on and powered by Thunkable. 
We are a team of engineering students and our objectives for this project is to
provide a platform for everyone who wants to enhance their wardrobe to escape the
monotony of the everyday wear.

In the event where the apk fails to install or if the app crashes due to unforeseen back-end limitations, use the Web Preview function on Thunkable.

This is a work in progress, so it only serves as a showcase of our idea.
